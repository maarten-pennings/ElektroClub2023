# Cost

This pages gives and overview of the costs.
My first assumption was to make 100 kits, but lately this is shifting towards 150 kits.

## Invoices

Due to long lead times (Ali Express), low-cost, and the need to know footprints
before ordering PCBs, I decided to already order some of the components.
Later I ordered the remaining, the third time I switched from 100 to 150 pieces.



### LED flash white for eyes (item 1a)

I forgot there are two eyes per kit so I ordered another 100.
Two times â‚¬4.58 is â‚¬9.16.

But then, I decided to switch to LEDs with yellow housing (instead of clear) 
so that the students do not confuse them with the clear red/blue one.
So these clear LEDs will not be used...

### LED flash yellow for eyes (item 1b)

I decided to switch to LEDs with yellow housing (instead of clear) so that the students do not confuse them with the clear red/blue one.
I also decided to aim at 150 kits, so 300 LEDs.

![LED yellow 300Ã—](cost2-led-yellow-300.png)




### LED no-flash logo and nose (item 2, 3, 4)

I divided shipping and discount (â‚¬5.00 - â‚¬0.04) over 3 items, that is â‚¬1.65 each.

Then green is â‚¬1.14 + â‚¬1.65 = â‚¬2.79, red is â‚¬1.07 + â‚¬1.65 = â‚¬2.72, 
and blue is â‚¬8.29 - â‚¬2.70 - â‚¬2.72 = â‚¬2.78.

![LED no-flash 3Ã—100](cost-led-red-100-blue-100-green-100.png)



Upgraded to 150 items. They got cheaper.
I divided shipping and discount (â‚¬4.87 - â‚¬0.04) over 3 items, that is â‚¬1.61 each.
Then green is â‚¬1.11 + â‚¬1.61 = â‚¬2.72, red is â‚¬1.04 + â‚¬1.61 = â‚¬2.65, 
and blue is â‚¬8.08 - â‚¬2.72 - â‚¬2.65 = â‚¬2.71.


![LED no-flash 3Ã—100](cost3-led-red-100-blue-100-green-100.png)


With that, green is â‚¬2.79+â‚¬2.72=â‚¬5.51, red is â‚¬2.72+â‚¬2.65=â‚¬5.37, and blue is â‚¬2.78+â‚¬2.71=â‚¬5.49.




### LED flash red/blue logo (item 5)

With shipping and discount â‚¬4.93.

![LED red/blue flash 150Ã—](cost-led-redblue-150.png)




### Resistors (item 6)

We have 6 LEDs per kit, so we need 600 resistors. I ordered 100 spare: â‚¬4.74.

![resistors 7Ã—100](cost-R220-700.png)


Upgraded to 150 items; that means 6Ã—150=900, we had 700 so I ordered another 200 for â‚¬2.07, bringing the total to â‚¬6.81.

![resistors 2Ã—100](cost3-R220-200.png)




### Power supply (item 7)

One of the harder decisions is the kind of power supply.

I found four options, prices below are for 100 kits.

 - 7a. dual AAA battery box with batteries - â‚¬68.10
 - 7b. 30cm USB cable met standard male A - â‚¬58.76
 - 7c. USB connector female C - â‚¬6.70
 - 7d. USB connector female micro B  - â‚¬6.75

When I ordered the USB micro B prices had gone up to â‚¬7.22.
![USB_micro 100](cost2-usbmicro-100.png)


The upgrade to 150 added 4.45 to 7.22 totaling â‚¬11.67.
![USB_micro 100](cost3-usbmicro-50.png)




### Zip-lock backs (item 8)

Zip-lock bags, big enough for PCB, which is estimated at 100Ã—60mmÂ². Cost â‚¬4.72.

![zip-lock bags](cost2-ziplock-200.png)




### Assembly manual (item 9)

Assumption: 150 times 1 page A4 a 10 cent, makes â‚¬15.00.




### PCBs (item 10, 11, 12)

First order 5 PCBs to see if all is ok. And maybe a second round.

![Trial run PCB](cost-pcb-5.png)


When trial runs are ok, order 100 pieces
