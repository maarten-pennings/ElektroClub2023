# Cost

This pages gives and overview of the costs.
My first assumption was to make 100 kits, but lately this is shifting towards 150 kits.

## Invoices

Due to long lead times (Ali Express), low-cost, and the need to know footprints
before ordering PCBs, I decided to already order some of the components.


### LED flash white for eyes (item 1)

I forgot there are two eyes per kit so I ordered another 100.
Two times â‚¬4.58 is â‚¬9.16.

![LED white 100Ã—](cost-led-white-100.png)

![LED white 100Ã— extra](cost-led-white-100extra.png)

I decided to switch to LEDs with yellow housing (instead of clear) so that the students do not confuse them with the clear red/blue one.
I also deiced to aim at 150 kits, so 300 LEDs.

![LED yellow 300Ã—](cost2-led-yellow-300.png)




### LED no-flash logo and nose (item 2, 3, 4)

I divided shipping and discount (â‚¬5.00 - â‚¬0.04) over 3 items, that is â‚¬1.65 each.

Then green is â‚¬1.14 + â‚¬1.65 = â‚¬2.79, red is â‚¬1.07 + â‚¬1.65 = â‚¬2.72, 
and blue is â‚¬8.29 - â‚¬2.70 - â‚¬2.72 = â‚¬2.78.

### LED flash red/blue logo (item 5)

With shipping and discount â‚¬4.93.

![LED red/blue flash 100Ã—](cost-led-redblue-150.png)



### Resistors (item 6)

We have 6 LEDs per kit, so we need 600 resistors. I ordered 100 spare: â‚¬4.74.

![resistors 7Ã—100](cost-R220-700.png)




### Power supply (item 7)

One of the harder decisions is the kind of power supply.

I found four options, prices below are for 100 kits.

 7a. dual AAA battery box with batteries - â‚¬68.10
 7b. 30cm USB cable met standard male A - â‚¬58.76
 7c. USB connector female C - â‚¬6.70
 7d. USB connector female micro B  - â‚¬6.75

### Zip-lock backs (item 8)

Zip-lock bags, big enough for PCB, which is estimated at 100Ã—60mmÂ².

![zip-lock bags](cost2-ziplock-200.png)




### Assembly manual (item 9)

Assumption: 1 page A4.




### PCBs (item 10, 11, 12)

First order 5 PCBs to see if all is ok. And maybe a second round.

![Trial run PCB](cost-pcb-5.png)


When trial runs are ok, order 100 pieces
